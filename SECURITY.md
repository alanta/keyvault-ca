# Security Policy

Your help in keeping KeyVault CA secure is greatly appreciated. Please follow this policy so we can triage and remediate issues quickly.

## Supported versions
We currently support security fixes on the `main` branch and the latest tagged release. Older releases may not receive fixes.

## Reporting a vulnerability
1. **Do not create a public issue.** Instead, use the GitHub Security Advisories feature (`Security` tab > `Report a vulnerability`) or email `marnix@alanta.nl` with the details.
2. Provide as much information as possible: affected version/commit, environment, reproduction steps, and any proof-of-concept code.
3. Encrypt sensitive information whenever feasible. We can provide a PGP key on request.

## Disclosure process
- We will acknowledge receipt within three business days.
- You will receive regular updates as we verify the issue and work on a fix.
- Once a fix is available, we will coordinate a disclosure date with you and credit reporters who wish to be recognized.

## Reporting non-security issues
Please use regular GitHub issues for bugs, questions, or feature requests that do not pose security risks.

Thank you for responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities and helping protect the community.
